# Sanitation for OpenAPI specification

This document records the sanitation done on top of the official OpenAPI specification from Spotify. 
The OpenAPI specification is obtained from the [Spotify OpenAPI Documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/reference/web-api/open-api-schema.yaml).
These changes are done in order to improve the overall usability, and as workarounds for some known language limitations.

[//]: # (TODO: Add sanitation details)
1. Remove resource paths,
    */playlists/{playlist_id}/images'(put) - schema for the image/jpeg content type is incorrectly defined
 

## OpenAPI cli command

The following command was used to generate the Ballerina client from the OpenAPI specification. The command should be executed from the repository root directory.

```bash
bal openapi -i docs/spec/openapi.yaml --mode client --license docs/license.txt -o ballerina
```
Note: The license year is hardcoded to 2024, change if necessary.
